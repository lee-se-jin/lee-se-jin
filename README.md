I'm a registered nurse in case management. I've been working as a nurse for over 6 years in hospitals, the community, and home care. Through the years I've seen how electronic patient health and medical records influence patient care. This inspired me to become involved in digital health! I'm currently studying applied computer science, and my goal is to become a nurse informaticist.
